## Requirements

To install requirements:

```setup
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

>ðŸ“‹  Describe how to set up the environment, e.g. pip/conda/docker commands, download datasets, etc...

Datasets (put under data folder):
- laion-400M, the training set of CLIP model, from which we sample foget set and retain set. First download the parquet files, and then use img2dataset to download the images. Use the following code https://github.com/rom1504/img2dataset/blob/main/dataset_examples/laion400m.md. The image-text pairs are stored in tar files such as 00000.tar, 00001.tar and so on. 
- ImageNet 2012. We use the imagenet validation set to evaluate CLIP model general performance. Request access here https://www.image-net.org/download.php
- CelebA. We sample identities in CelebA dataset to forget. The dataset is available here https://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html. Request the dataset authors for the name of identities.

Update `data_root` in `src/clip/a0_eval_celeba.py` to the directroy you stored the experimental data.

## Unlearning procedure

1. Prepare a forget and a retain set. Given an unlearning task, we first curate a forget set containing relevant image-text pairs, then select a retain set.

2. Calculate the gradient from the forget and retain sets by running
```setup
bash scripts/run_clip_name.sh
```
This will generate the forgetting gradient file stored at ...

3. Perform the _Single Layer Single Gradient_ update by running
```setup
bash scripts/run.sh
```

4. 

## Unlearning experiment on Stable diffusion
Before start, generate necessary dataset files and gradient files following steps described in _Unlearning procedure_.
Run Jupyter notebook `notebooks/experiment_stable_diffusion.ipynb`

## Unlearning experiment on Vision-language models
Before start, generate necessary dataset files and gradient files following steps described in _Unlearning procedure_.
Run Jupyter notebook `notebooks/experiment_vision_language.ipynb`

## Experimental gradient files (pre-trained)
TODO: upload gradient files to a google drive for fast reproducibility verifications.
